DeepSeek-V2 (Omiixx-nova Edition)
Powerful, Efficient, and Scalable Mixture-of-Experts Language Model

1. Introduction
DeepSeek-V2 is an advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for economical training and high-performance inference. With 236 billion parameters, it activates only 21 billion per token, striking a balance between strength and efficiency. Compared to its predecessor DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 reduces training costs by 42.5%, cuts KV cache size by 93.3%, and increases generation throughput by 5.76Ã—.

Pretrained on 8.1 trillion tokens from a diverse, high-quality corpus, DeepSeek-V2 unlocks powerful language understanding through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and open-ended tasks.

Note: HuggingFace performance may lag internal implementations. For optimal latency and throughput, use the dedicated vLLM or SGLang frameworks (links below).

4. Evaluation Highlights
DeepSeek-V2 (Omiixx-nova) achieves superior accuracy across multilingual benchmarks including MMLU, BBH, C-Eval, CMMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, and more â€” outperforming many contemporary models of similar or larger scale.

5. Architecture Overview
MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention): Optimized attention mechanism reducing KV cache bottlenecks for faster inference.

DeepSeekMoE: State-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts FFNs enabling cost-efficient training of ultra-large models.

6. How to Run Locally
Requirements
80GB*8 GPUs for BF16 inference on full DeepSeek-V2.

Example: HuggingFace Transformers
python
Copy
Edit
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, GenerationConfig

model_name = "omiiixx-nova/DeepSeek-V2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
max_memory = {i: "75GB" for i in range(8)}

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="sequential",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    max_memory=max_memory,
    attn_implementation="eager",
)
model.generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(model_name)
model.generation_config.pad_token_id = model.generation_config.eos_token_id

text = "An attention function maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output..."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs.to(model.device), max_new_tokens=100)

print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
